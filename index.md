# FTL store statistics

## Method

I visited 100 stores for each ship tested (buying nothing).

This was tedious and I went fast, so doubtless I made a few errors recording data (but not many).

## Number of store slots

A "slot" is a container for items, such as weapons. For example, with Kestrel A, 27% of stores had 2 slots (i.e. a one-page store).

| Number of slots | Kestrel A | Engi A | Engi B | Mantis A |
| :-------------: | :-------: | :----: | :----: | :------: |
| 2               | 27        | 37     | 44     | 35       |
| 3               | 29        | 31     | 29     | 24       |
| 4               | 44        | 32     | 27     | 41       |

## Categories

For example, with Kestrel A, 83% of stores sold systems.
